I'm an SF-native currently putting [my](https://pablohansengrowth.substack.com/) [thoughts](https://architecting-ambition.ghost.io/) [online](https://creative-horizons.ghost.io/tag/archive/) as I run a consulting company and a product studio.
 
I previously worked at a stealth startup and am finishing up a Master's in AI.
