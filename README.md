I'm an SF-native currently putting [my](https://pablohansengrowth.substack.com/) [thoughts](https://ambition.seraphiclabs.com/) [online](https://creative.seraphiclabs.com/) as I run a consulting company and a product studio.
 
I previously worked at a stealth startup and am finishing up a Master's in AI.
